In **September 2018**, Facebook disclosed a significant data breach that affected nearly **50 million user accounts**. This incident was particularly notable as it occurred during a tumultuous period for the company, following the **Cambridge Analytica scandal** earlier that year.

### What Happened?

- **Vulnerability Exploited**: Attackers exploited a vulnerability in Facebook’s **“View As”** feature, which allows users to see how their profiles appear to others. This flaw existed from **July 2017** until its discovery on **September 16, 2018**. The attackers utilized this vulnerability to steal **access tokens**, which are essentially digital keys that keep users logged into their accounts without needing to re-enter passwords [1][2][3].
  
- **Scope of the Breach**: Initially, Facebook estimated that **50 million accounts** were at risk. However, further investigation revealed that about **30 million accounts** had their tokens stolen, allowing attackers to access personal information such as names, contact details, and other profile data [2][3].

### CISO's Involvement and Response

At the time of the breach, Facebook's Chief Security Officer was **Alex Stamos**. His role in the aftermath of the incident included:

1. **Investigation and Disclosure**: Following the breach's discovery, Stamos and his team initiated an investigation and promptly informed law enforcement agencies, including the FBI. The company communicated with users about potential risks and reset access tokens for those affected [1][3].

2. **Public Communication**: Stamos emphasized the importance of user privacy and security in public statements, acknowledging the breach's severity and its implications for user trust in Facebook’s ability to protect data [2].

3. **Security Improvements**: In response to the breach, Facebook implemented additional security measures and fixed the vulnerabilities that allowed the attack to occur. They also disabled the “View As” feature temporarily while addressing these issues [1][3].

### Implications for Facebook

The breach had significant repercussions for Facebook:
- **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Following this incident, Facebook faced increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide, particularly regarding compliance with data protection laws like GDPR. There were discussions about potential fines if it was found that Facebook had violated these regulations [2][3].
  
- **Impact on User Trust**: The breach further eroded user trust in Facebook's ability to safeguard personal information, coming on the heels of previous scandals involving data misuse [1][2].

### Conclusion

The 2018 Facebook data breach serves as a critical example of how vulnerabilities can be exploited in large platforms and highlights the essential role of cybersecurity leadership in managing such crises. Alex Stamos’ involvement in addressing the breach underscores the complexity of maintaining security in an organization handling vast amounts of user data. The incident not only prompted immediate security enhancements but also initiated broader discussions about accountability and regulatory measures within the tech industry.
